### Guidelines for PYTHON

#### FLASK

- Use Flask Blueprints to organize routes and views by feature or domain for better code organization
- Implement Flask-SQLAlchemy with proper session management to prevent connection leaks and memory issues
- Use Flask-Marshmallow for serialization and request validation of {{data_types}}
- Apply the application factory pattern to enable testing and multiple deployment configurations
- Implement Flask-Limiter for rate limiting on public endpoints to prevent abuse of {{public_apis}}
- Use Flask-Login or Flask-JWT-Extended for authentication with proper session timeout and refresh mechanisms
