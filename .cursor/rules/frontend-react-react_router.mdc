### Guidelines for REACT

#### REACT_ROUTER

- Use createBrowserRouter instead of BrowserRouter for better data loading and error handling
- Implement lazy loading with React.lazy() for route components to improve initial load time
- Use the useNavigate hook instead of the navigate component prop for programmatic navigation
- Leverage loader and action functions to handle data fetching and mutations at the route level
- Implement error boundaries with errorElement to gracefully handle routing and data errors
- Use relative paths with dot notation (e.g., "../parent") to maintain route hierarchy flexibility
- Utilize the useRouteLoaderData hook to access data from parent routes
- Implement fetchers for non-navigation data mutations
- Use route.lazy() for route-level code splitting with automatic loading states
- Implement shouldRevalidate functions to control when data revalidation happens after navigation
